This is a pseudo HTML file. It has a less than (<) &ampamp;
a greater than (>) symbol in it but they aren’t &amphf;
<em>really</em> used as markup at all.
<p>
<P>All the browser really does is look for the tags
it recognizes, so that if it finds a tag that it isn’t
setup to interpret like&ampnbsp;<point><font color="red">
this</font></point> one, it will simply ignore it.
